SODING TASK
###################

Soding Task is a simple CRUD Application built in Codeigniter Framework using PHP and javascript. 
Its goal is to add, edit, delete and display task.

*******************
Server Requirements
*******************

PHP version 5.5 or newer is recommended (I used xampp as my local server).

It should work on 5.4.7 as well, but we strongly advise you NOT to run
such old versions of PHP, because of potential security and performance
issues, as well as missing features.

************
